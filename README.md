# PosTER
Implementation of PosTER - Pose Transformer Encoder Representation - for pedestrian attributes recognition 

## First steps

+ Decide on which pedestrian attribute to work on (chose 2-3) [JAAD Dataset](https://github.com/ykotseruba/JAAD) and [TITAN Dataset](https://usa.honda-ri.com/titan)
+ Reproduce some results with SOTA methods for these attributes
+ Train PosTER on unlabeled human poses
+ Fine-tune PosTER on these attributes
